<h2><a name="pgfId_695974"></a>Purpose of Document</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>This document presents a
description of the functions provided by the Alarm Handler (ALH) and describes
its graphical user interface. The purpose of this guide is to explain how to
use and configure the Alarm Handler.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_694953"></a>Audience</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>This guide is written
for individuals who wish to use and understand the Alarm Handler, namely
accelerator operators and accelerator physicists.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_694788"></a>Background/Environment</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler is
part of the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System 
EPICS) co-developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory
and Argonne National Laboratory. EPICS consists of a set of software components
and tools with which application developers and designers can create an
extremely flexible control system that minimizes the need for custom coding and
helps ensure uniform operator interfaces. The Alarm Handler is one of the EPICS
control system tools.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_695229"></a>EPICS Control System Perspective</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler
provides an interface between an operator and the EPICS control system
database. The database is the interface
between instrumentation hardware and all the EPICS control system software
tools. This database is distributed throughout a network on I/O Controllers and
contains records that are used to transfer information to and from the attached
instrumentation to the Alarm Handler and other EPICS software tools.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Database records are
made up of fields of various types. Scan fields specify under what
circumstances a record will be processed. Convert fields determine how to
convert a raw signal to/from engineering units. Device fields are used to
specify the software interface to the device. Operator display fields specify
how to display the record value. Processing fields are used by the run-time
code for processing the record. There are also alarm
fields that are used to specify conditions for alarm and to determine if the
record is in an alarm state. Most fields are accessible throughout the network
by means of the channel access interface
software layer by specifying the record name and the field name. All monitoring
and control operations are performed through the database.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_696039"></a>Alarm Fields</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Each record in the
database includes fields for specifying the record's current alarm condition.
There are two parts to this alarm condition: the alarm status and the severity
of that alarm status. Alarm status and severity values are set and checked
whenever a record is processed. When a new condition is detected, a routine is
called to send a message to each process monitoring this record. The Alarm
Handler is one of these processes. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Each database record also includes two fields for
specifying the record's current alarm acknowledgment state. The unacknowledged
severity field is the highest severity value of unacknowledged alarms, and the
acknowledge transients field specifies whether transient alarms need to be
acknowledged. A transient alarm is when the record enters alarm state and then
returns to normal before the alarm is acknowledged. When any change to these
fields is detected, a routine is called to send a message to each process
monitoring this record. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler filters alarm messages and
displays alarms to the operator hierarchically. The alarm configuration
structure defined in the alarm configuration file is used to determine this
hierarchical display. The Alarm Handler brings alarms to the operator's
attention, logs the alarms, allows the operator to acknowledge alarms, and
gives the operator guidance on handling of specific alarms.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_698700"></a>What is the Alarm Handler?</h2>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Definition</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The
Alarm Handler is an interactive graphical application
used primarily by accelerator operators and physicists to display and monitor
EPICS database alarm states. It serves as an interface between an operator and
the EPICS database and it communicates with the database using channel access
function calls. The user interface for the Alarm Handler contains a
hierarchical display of an alarm configuration structure allowing both high
level and detailed views of the alarm configuration structure in one window.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Availability</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The alarm handler is a
Motif and X11 Window based application written in C language, and it runs on
Unix, Linux, and Windows 95/NT hosts. The Alarm Handler source code is
available via WWW as an EPICS extension.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_696087"></a>Purpose of the Alarm Handler</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler monitors
alarm conditions of EPICS database records. The primary responsibilities of the
Alarm Handler (ALH) are to:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li>Bring alarms to the operator's attention. </li>
  <li>Provide the operator guidance for handling of specific alarms </li>
  <li>Allow the operator to globally acknowledge alarms. </li>
  <li>Provide a graphical view of current database alarms </li>
  <li>Provide for logging alarms and display of the logged alarm history </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="pgfId_696669"></a>System Requirements</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler currently requires either 
an IBM personal computer with Windows 95/NT and Hummingbird's
Exceed software or a workstation running a Unix type operating system with X
Windows and Motif Version 1.2 or above. The Alarm Handler also requires the
global alarm acknowledgment in EPICS base Version 3.11 or above.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_697562"></a>Alarm Handler Terminology </h2>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>An unexpected change of
state for an EPICS database record. Examples of alarm conditions are:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li>Deviations from tolerance band </li>
  <li>Software or Hardware errors </li>
  <li>Loss of communication to hardware or linked records </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>There are two parts to
an alarm: the alarm status and the severity of that alarm status. Alarm status
and severity are set and checked whenever a record is processed. When a change
is detected, a routine is called which sends a message to each process
monitoring this record. The Alarm Handler may be one of these processes. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Severity</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The SEVR alarm field in
an EPICS database record specifies the severity of an alarm state. Currently
the alarm severity can take one of the following four values:</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0in'>NO_ALARM, MINOR, MAJOR,
INVALID</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Status </h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Each EPICS database
record has a STAT alarm field that specifies the alarm state of the database
record. Currently the status field can take one of more than 20 values, some of
which are:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.5in'>READ, WRITE, HIHI,
HIGH, LOW, LOLO, STATE, COS, COMM, ...</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Channels</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler
displays alarms for an arbitrary set of channels. Each Alarm Channel refers to
a specific EPICS database record.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Groups</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler
provides a grouping mechanism so that related channels can be grouped together.
An Alarm Group consists of a named set of lower level groups and/or database
channels.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Error State</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>An Alarm Channel will be considered in an error
state if there is a loss of communication between the Alarm Handler and the
channel or if a channel access exception or other error occurs on the channel. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Local / Global Mode</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The alarm handler can execute in either a local or
global mode. Global mode means that unacknowledged severity and acknowledge transients
states will be determined by the current value of the fields in an EPICS
database record. Local mode means that the unacknowledged severity and
acknowledge transients states are local alh settings. Command line options
determine the execution mode with local mode being the default setting. There
is no way to change between local and global mode during execution. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Passive / Active State</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The alarm handler can execute
in either a passive (monitor) or active (modify) state. Passive state means
that the alarm handler does not allow alarm acknowledgment and does not allow
changes to acknowledge transients settings. There will be no
channel access puts when executing in a passive state. The passive/active
execution state is determined by a command line option with active state being
the default and there is no way to change the current state during execution.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Acknowledgment</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In Global Mode the Alarm
Handler reads all ACKT and ACKS fields of the configured Alarm Channels:
the Alarm Handler starts with
the complete memory of still unacknowledged alarms. These alarms will have to
be acknowledged, even if some may not be active anymore. (If a channel's ACKT
field is set, any transient alarm will be latched and has to be acknowledged
later on.) Global Mode also makes the Alarm Handler write alarm
acknowledgements into the channels using Channel Access, i.e. all other Alarm
Handlers in Global Mode will receive an alarm acknowledgment. Usually, all
Alarm Handlers in the Control Room will run in Global Mode, so that any alarm
has to be acknowledged only on one of the Alarm Handlers.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In Local Mode, the Alarm Handler starts without
reading open acknowledgements from the channels, all alarm acknowledgements
made will be valid only for this instance of the Alarm Handler. Usually, Alarm
Handlers outside of the Control Room will run in Local Mode. </p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_696541"></a>Alarm Handler Windows</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler display consists of two types of
windows, a runtime window and a Main Window. While the Alarm Handler is
executing, the runtime window is always displayed.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Runtime Window</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The runtime window is a
small icon like window that contains a single button containing the name of the
alarm configuration main Alarm Group. The color
of this button is used to show the highest alarm severity of any outstanding
alarms. Beeping and blinking of the button is
used to show the presence of unacknowledged alarms. Pressing the runtime window
button will open the Alarm Handler Main Window or, if already open, bring the
Main Window to the top of the window stack. The Close or Quit item on the
window manager menu allows the user to exit
the Alarm Handler.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Main Window</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler Main
Window is divided into three parts: a menu bar, an alarm configuration display
area, and a message area.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>On the
menu bar, there are selections for pull-down menu
items that perform all the functions of the Alarm Handler.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The alarm configuration
display area is divided into two major parts: an alarm configuration tree
structure display and an Alarm Group contents
display. The current alarm configuration tree structure appears in the first
area, and a list of the contents of the currently selected Alarm Group from the
alarm configuration tree structure appears in the second area.
Color is used to show alarm severity. A single
character severity code is also provided for
an operator with a monochrome display.</p>


<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The
message area displays the name of the current
configuration file and has indicators to show definitions of the summary alarms
fields for the currently open alarm configuration file.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_692043"></a>Alarm Handler Files</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>There are three files
used by the alarm handler while it is executing. They are the
alarm configuration file, the
alarm log file, and the operation modification log file.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Configuration File</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The
alarm configuration file is the only file used as
input to the Alarm Handler. This file defines the Alarm Group structure and
takes data in a flexible input format. The alarm configuration
file specifies the Alarm Groups, Alarm Channels, channel masks, hierarchy of
Alarm Groups, and other configuration information. The format and contents of
the alarm configuration file are described in <a href="#chapter_6">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The user can specify the
desired alarm configuration file using a file selection window at Alarm Handler
start-up, or on the command line.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Log File</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Log output file contains a log of alarm
state changes. For each change of alarm state, channel access connection state,
and read/write access state, the date, time, channel name and current state
values are recorded. The alarm log file is an ASCII file that can be displayed
on any terminal or sent to a printer.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Operation Modification Log File</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Operation
Modification Log output file contains a log of alarm acknowledgments and
changes the user has made to the current alarm handler configuration. For each
operator modification the date, time and description of the operator's
modification are recorded.</p>

<h2>Path Requirements<a name="pgfId_679120"></a></h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Before invoking the
Alarm Handler for the first time, the path
to the executable and configuration files
must be established. Contact your EPICS administrator to find the locations of
the Alarm Handler executable, <i> alh</i>, and your site's Alarm Handler
configuration input files.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_699316"></a>Environment Variable</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The optional environment
variable <i>ALARMHANDLER </i>can be used to point
the Alarm Handler to a desired working directory. If <i>ALARMHANDLER</i> is not
set, the current working directory is assumed. If the alarm configuration file
resides on a different directory
(e.g. /<i>home<i>/</i>cs</i>/<i>appl</i>/<i>ah</i>/<i>dev</i>)
from the current working directory, under UNIX <i>ALARMHANDLER</i>
can be set to point to the desired path by issuing the UNIX c shell command:</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0in'>setenv ALARMHANDLER /home/cs/appl/ah/dev</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The user must have read
and write privileges in this directory.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_699228"></a>Command Line Syntax </h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Once the path is properly
set, invoke the Alarm Handler by executing the command:</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0in'>alh</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>This command displays a
file selection box in which to specify an alarm configuration file name. The
default path for files is the directory defined by the ALARMHANDLER environment
variable or the current directory and the default alarm handler output file
names are <i>ALH</i>-<i>default</i>.<i>alhAlarm and ALH-default.alhOpmod</i> .
If there is an alarm configuration file in the current directory with the name
ALH-default.alhConfig, it will be used as the input configuration file.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The Alarm Handler
command has several options and a usage
message similar to the table below will be displayed if you enter: &quot;alh
-help&quot;. </p>

<p style='margin-left:3.0in'>alh [OPTIONS] [Xoptions] [configfile] </p>

 </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="pgfId_699460"></a>Command Line Option Descriptions</h2>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Configuration File</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The '<i> configfile</i>
' option specifies which alarm configuration input file is to be used. The
default is no configuration file and a file selection window is displayed.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm Log File</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The '<i>-a alarmlogfile</i>
' option specifies the name of the alarm log file. The default name is
ALH-default.alhAlarm.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Log alarms into CMLOG system</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-aCM'</i> option enables alarm logging into
a CMLOG system. The default is not to use CMLOG. (Note: This option is only available
if the Alarm Handler is compiled with CMLOG support.)</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Message Broadcast System</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The '<i>-B</i>' option enables an operator to send
messages using message broadcasting. The default is no message broadcasting.
When this option is specified a send message menu item appears on the Main
Window menu, and a message input dialog popup appears when the menu item is
selected. The operator can then type in a message that will be sent to other
alh processes when OK is pressed. A popup dialog box containing a sent message
will appear when an Alarm Handler process receives a message.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Configuration Tool Mode</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The '<i>-c</i> ' option causes the Alarm Handler to
enter the Alarm Configuration Tool mode. The default is to bring up Alarm
Handler mode. The Alarm Configuration Tool mode is used for creating and
editing alarm configuration files. Documentation for this mode will be added to
this guide later. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Write Configuration File ACKT Settings on Startup</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The '<i> -caputackt</i>
' option specifies that the Alarm Handler should write the alarm configuration
file ACKT values using channel access puts to the EPICS database records when
the Alarm Handler reads the configuration file. The default is not to write the
alarm configuration file ACKT values.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Disable Writing</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The ' <i>-D</i> ' option
allows running the Alarm Handler without creating and/or modifying the alarm
log and alarm opmod files. This is useful if one alh process runs without this
option, creating and modifying some fixed named alarm log files and all other
alh process specifying the same file names run with the -D option which does
not allow them to overwrite the alarm log files. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Debug output</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-debug'</i> option specifies that debugging
output should be printed to stdout. The default is not to print debug output.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Description field</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-desc_field'</i> option specifies that .DESC
field text should be printed on alarmLog output lines. The default
is not to print .DESC field text.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Directory for All Files</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-f filedir '</i>
option specifies the directory for the Alarm Handler input and output files.
The default location is the current working directory. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Set Alarm Display Filter</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-filter f-opt'</i> option sets the initial
alarm display filter for the Alarm Handler (see <a href="#DisplayFilter">-&gt;&gt;Menu
Functions-&gt;Setup Menu-&gt;Display Filter</a>). `f-opt' may be one of `n[o]'
(for no filter), `a[ct]' (show active alarms) or `u[nack]' (show only
unacknowledged alarms). Default is `no', i.e. all Alarm Groups
and channels in the current configuration will be displayed. This
option is particularly useful in combination with `-mainwindow' to start Alarm
Handlers from operator panels.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Global Mode</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-global'</i> options specifies that
the alarm handler should run in a global mode. In global mode an Alarm
Channel's unacknowledged severity and it's acknowledge transients state will be
determined by the current value of the EPICS database record's ACKS and ACKT
field settings. In local mode, the default mode, the unacknowledged severity
and acknowledge transients settings are local to the alarm handler. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Help</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-help'</i> option will print alh command
usage text to stdout. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Locking System</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-L'</i> option activates a file locking
system (based on lockf(), i.e. NFS-safe) making sure that only one of multiple
Alarm Handlers with enabled log writing has access to the log. If the `master'
(i.e. actively logging) process dies, another Alarm Handler will seamlessly
take over logging. Default is not to use this locking mechanism.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Directory for Log Files</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-l logdir'</i>
option specifies the location of the alarm log file and the operation
modification log file. The default location is the current working directory. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Maximum Alarm Log Records</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The '<i>-m maxrecords'</i> option allows the user
to specify the maximum number of records that the alarm handler will allow in
the alarm log file. If this number of records is reached, new records
will overwrite old alarm records. The default number of records is 2000.
Specifying zero means the file can have an unlimited number of records.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Start with Main Window </h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>`-mainwindow'</i> option makes the Alarm
Handler start with the Main Window instead of the Runtime Window. This is
useful in conjunction with the `-filter f-opt' option to start Alarm Handlers
from operator panels. The default is to start with the Runtime Window.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Do not use Popup Boxes for Displaying Errors</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The `-<i>noerrorpopup'</i> option tells the Alarm
Handler not to use popup boxes for displaying errors. This is useful for Alarm
Handlers running as overhead displays (and no mouse attached to handle popups).
The default is to use popups.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Database</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-O key'</i> means that the alarm
handler should send log messages to a database (Oracle).</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>OpMod Log File</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The -<i>'o opmodlogfile'</i> option specifies the
location of the operation modification log file. The default location is the
current working directory. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Log Operator Modifications into CMLOG system</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-oCM'</i> option enables opmod logging into
a CMLOG system. The default is not to use CMLOG. (Note: This option is only
available if the Alarm Handler is compiled with CMLOG support.)</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>TCP Printing</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-P'</i> option
allows simultaneously printing of new alarms to the log file and to a TCP
printer (socket connection). The user must specify all three printer values: <i>'Name:port:colorModel</i>
' (where colorModel is mono,hp_color,...). Currently the printing is done
asynchronously by adding an additional task &quot;alh_printer&quot;. (This
option is still under construction and will use pipes in the future) </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Silent Mode</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The <i>'-s'</i>
option specifies that alh should start executing in a silent mode with no
beeping when alarms are present. Setup menu items can be used to change the
startup silence status.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Passive Mode</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Specifying this <i>'-S'</i>
option means that the alh will execute in a passive (monitor) mode. This
means that alh can not send channel access acknowledgment of alarms and can not
do channel access puts to the acknowledge transients fields and cannot write to
the severity process variable. It is useful for a non-operator alh user.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Acknowledge Alarm</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarm acknowledgment is
only allowed while the alarm handler is executing in active (modify) state. The
Alarm Handler user can acknowledge an alarm for the currently selected Alarm
Group or Channel by selecting the &quot;Acknowledge Alarm&quot; item on the
Action menu. Selecting this item for an Alarm Group acknowledges all Alarm
Channels associated with the group. It has the same effect as acknowledging
each channel individually.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>When executing in global mode the Alarm Handler
performs an alarm acknowledgment by sending a channel access alarm acknowledgment
command to the channel and logging the alarm acknowledgement to the operator
modification log file. The alarm acknowledgment indicators (color, blinking,
and beeping) will change only after a channel access alarm event with the
modified unacknowledged severity is received. Other executing alarm handler
processes and other EPICS tools monitoring alarm events will also receive this
alarm event.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>When executing in local mode the alarm
acknowledgment indicators (color, blinking and beeping) and the local unacknowledged
severity level setting will change to reflect a local alarm acknowledgment and
the alarm acknowledgement will be logged to the operator modification log file.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Force Mask</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Selecting &quot;Force
Mask&quot; will popup a dialog box which allows the operator to change the mask
for the currently selected group or channel. Changing a group mask will
actually change the mask of all Alarm Channels
within that group. Three masks are displayed: 1) the current mask,
2) the reset mask, valid for Alarm Channels only, which is the mask specified
in the alarm configuration file, and 3) the mask to force, which the user
defines by pressing one or more of the 5 state buttons below the mask.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>There are four action
buttons on this dialog box: Apply, Reset, Dismiss and Help. The Apply button will
set the mask of all the Alarm Channels
within this group to the mask as shown in the Mask line. The Reset
button will reset the mask of each channel within this group to its own default
mask defined in the alarm configuration file. The Dismiss button will cancel
the force mask option and close the dialog window. The Help button will give
force mask help information.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Modify Mask Settings</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>This menu item allows
the operator to force or reset a specific bit of the current mask. For example,
if the operator chooses &quot;Add&quot; in the &quot;Add/Cancel Alarms&quot;
line then the Add/Cancel field of the current mask for all channels in the
group are forced into the &quot;Add&quot; event state. Similarly choosing
&quot;Cancel&quot; cancels the channel access add event state for all the
channels. If &quot;Reset&quot; is chosen, the Add/Cancel field of the current
mask for each channel in the group reverts to the default state defined in the
active configuration file. Mask values are described in a later chapter.</p>

</a>Chapter 6: Alarm Configuration File</h1>

<h2><a name="pgfId_689941"></a>Configuration File Description</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The alarm configuration
file is the file used as input to the Alarm Handler. This file defines the
Alarm Group structure and takes data in a flexible input format. The alarm configuration
file, which can be prepared via any text editor, defines a complete Alarm Group
structure composed of subgroups and channels. The arrangement of channels and
subgroups follow the standard tree structure. The subgroups always terminate at
channels. The only input format constraint is that the definitions must be in
hierarchical order. That is, after a group is defined in the configuration file
as belonging to a parent group, all its subgroups and channels must be defined
in the configuration file before a new group belonging to the same parent group
can be defined. There can be only one top-level group (main group) and this
group must have NULL as the parent group name. For each group or channel, a set
of input specifications is used to define special events to be taken care of at
start-up time.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_692527"></a>File Name</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>When opening a new configuration file,
&quot;.alhConfig&quot; will be used as the default suffix.
The default file name for the alarm configuration file is
ALH-default.alhConfig.</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_692528"></a>Input Format</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The configuration file

</ul>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Heartbeat Process Variable</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with $HEARTBEATPV is optional.
It is required only when a user wants a monitored pv to show weather or not
ALH is running. If the $HEARTBEATPV line is present, ALH will do CA puts of
the specified value to the specified pv at the specified rate (in seconds). 
The heartbeatPVName must be an existing PV in the EPICS database and can be
specified as &lt;channel_name&gt;.&lt;field_name&gt;.
</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Group or Channel</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>A set of group or channel lines must appear
in the alarm configuration file. These lines define the Alarm
Group structure. The first line is the top level Alarm Group definition. 
There can be only one top-level Alarm Group and this Alarm Group must have
NULL as the parent group name. Group or Channel lines must start with the
keyword GROUP or CHANNEL. The GroupName is the name of a user specified
Alarm Group. The ChannelName must be the name of a specific record defined 
in an EPICS database. The length of a GroupName or ChannelName must not
exceed 28 characters.  The parentName is the name of the parent Alarm
Group. There is no restriction on the number of group definitions. </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>GROUP parentName GroupName</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The channel &lt;mask&gt; is optional and defaults to no
mask (i.e. -----). It is required only for a channel with a non default mask
setting. The detailed description of mask settings is given in 
<a href="#masks">Alarm Channel Mask</a> in this Chapter.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>CHANNEL parentName ChannelName &lt;mask&gt; </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Include File</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with
INCLUDE allows a user to designate, within his alarm configuration file, the
name of another alarm configuration file to be read by the Alarm Handler at
runtime. The main Alarm Group of the designated file will become a child group
of the parentName group specified on the INCLUDE line.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>INCLUDE parentName fileName </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Acknowledge Process Variable</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with $ACKPV is optional.
It is required only when a user wants to write a user specified value
(ackValue) to an acknowledge process variable (ackPVName) when a
channel's alarm is acknowledged.  The acknowledge Process variable
must be defined in the IOC database and is specified as
&lt;record_name&gt;.&lt;field_name&gt;. Whenever the channel's alarm is
acknowledged, the acknowledge value (ackValue) is written to the
acknowledge process variable via a channel access put (ca_put) request. 
Writes to an acknowledge process variable are done only when the alarm
handler is in global active mode.
</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$ACKPV ackPVName ackValue</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Force Process Variable</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The lines starting with
$FORCEPV are optional. They are required only when a user wants to let ALH automate
changing an alarm group or channel's mask values by monitoring an EPICS database
process variable or by monitoring the value of a calulated expression based on PV values.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>
The first method is to monitor a single EPICS database process variable.
Only only one input line is required.  This line defines the forcePVName (process
variable to be monitored), forceMask, forceValue, and resetValue. The forcePVName
must be an existing PV in the EPICS database and can be specified as
&lt;channel_name&gt;.&lt;field_name&gt;. Whenever the value of the force process
variable changes to be the same as the forceValue, the Alarm Group or Channel
mask will be set to the forceMask. For an Alarm Group, this means that masks of
all the channels in the group and its subgroups are set to the forceMask.
Whenever the value of the force process variable changes to be the same as the
resetValue, these channel masks are set to their default values. The forceValue
must be different from the resetValue. The default setting is forceValue = 1,
and resetValue = 0. A "NE" can be used in the resetValue field to reset the
masks when the value of the force process variable no longer equals the force value.
Alarm Handler menu items exist which allow the  user to enable/disable the Force PV,
change the name of the Force PV, and  change the Force Process Variable values.
The force PV test uses type double for forceValue, resetValue and pv value. 
</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$FORCEPV forcePVName forceMask &lt;forceValue&gt;
&lt;resetValue&gt; </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>
The second method is to monitor the value of a calculated expression. This
requires multiple Force PV CALC input lines to define the expression.
This CALC facility allows algebraic, relational, and logical
operations on up to 6 pv values. The result of the expression
is compared to the forcePV forceValue and resetValue to determine
whether or not to set group/channel masks.
</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>
To specify a forcpePV calculation expression in the alhConfig
file you create the $FORCEPV record as before but you specify
"CALC" instead of a PV name. Then you add a new $FORCEPV_CALC
line in which you specify the calculation expression in a
manner similar to the calc record expression. In fact alh
uses the same code as the calc record to evaluate the
expression. You specify the expression using A, B, ... instead
of the pvnames. Then you add $FORCEPV_CALC_A through
$FORCEPV_CALC_F lines to specify the pv names.  (You can also
specify constant values on these lines.)
The Alarm Handler ForcePV dialog window allows users to specify 
or change the ForcePV CALC data.
</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>
An example of the alhConfig file lines for a calculation
forcePV is
</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>
                $FORCEPV    CALC  ---TL 18.321 NE <br>

                $FORCEPV_CALC_C  5.321 <br>

</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.5in'>
The expression is evaluated using type "double" for all pv
values and constants.
</p>



<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Severity Process Variable</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with
$SEVRPV is optional. It is required only when a user wants to write the
severity value of a group or channel to a process variable. The sevrPVName must
be defined in the IOC database and is specified as
&lt;channel_name&gt;.&lt;field_name&gt;. Whenever the group or channel severity
changes, the new severity value is written to the severity process variable via
a channel access put (ca_put) request. Writes to a severity process variable 
are done only when the alarm handler is in global active mode.
The value -1 is written to the servrity PV when the group or channel is disabled.
</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$SEVRPV sevrPVName </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Guidance</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The lines starting with
$GUIDANCE are optional. They are required only when a user wants to display
alarm guidance information for a group or channel. The $GUIDANCE line may be
followed by a set of ascii guidance text lines with an $END line to terminate
the guidance text, or alternatively, the
$GUIDANCE line may contain a url address.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$GUIDANCE </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Alias</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with
$ALIAS is optional. It is required when it is desired that the alarm handler
display the specified alias text string in places where it would normally
display the Alarm Group or Alarm Channel name.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$ALIAS&nbsp;&nbsp; anyValidTextString </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Related Command</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with $COMMAND
is optional. It is required only when a user wants to provide the feature of
starting a related process for this group or channel. The related process will
be invoked when the alh operator clicks on the Process button in the alarm
handler Main Window display.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; anyValidCommandSyntax </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Severity Command</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with
$SEVRCOMMAND is optional. It is required if a process should be invoked when
the alarm severity value for a group or channel changes. A single group or
channel may have multiple $SEVRCOMMAND lines. This line defines the change in
the severity necessary to start the process and defines the process to be
started.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Valid severity change values are -</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>UP_INVALID, UP_MAJOR,
UP_MINOR, UP_ANY, DOWN_MAJOR, DOWN_MINOR, DOWN_NO_ALARM, DOWN_ANY, UP_ALARM</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Status Command</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with
$STATCOMMAND is optional and valid only for an Alarm Channel. It is required
only when the alarm handler should start a process when the channel alarm
status becomes a specified value. A single channel may have multiple
$STATCOMMAND lines. This line defines the status value necessary to start the
process and defines the process to be started. Valid alarm status string values
can be found in the EPICS base alarmString.h header file.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Example alarm status string values are -</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>NO_ALARM, READ, WRITE,

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Alarm Count Filter</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with $ALARMCOUNTFILTER is
optional. It is required only when the alarm handler should filter the
registration of alarms for a channel. This line defines the alarm
count and seconds required for alarm registration. To register as an alarm, a
channel must remain in an alarm state for more than inputSeconds seconds or the
channel must enter into an alarm state from a no-alarm state more than
inputCount times within inputSeconds seconds.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$ALARMCOUNTFILTER inputCount inputSeconds </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Beep Severity</u></h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The line starting with
$BEEPSEVERITY is optional. It is required only when the alarm handler should
filter the beeping if alarms are present. This line defines the minimum
severity level required for beeping. Beeping will not occur when the highest
outstanding severity is less than the specified severity. Valid severity 
values are MINOR, MAJOR, INVALID, and ERROR.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>$BEEPSEVERITY severity </p>

<h2>Sample Configuration File</h2>

CHANNEL BBB rbi_2000<br>
<br>
GROUP MAIN CCC<br>
CHANNEL CCC rbo_000<br>
CHANNEL MAIN rbo_001<br>
</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In this example, the
first group is named MAIN. The MAIN group contains three subgroups ( AAA, BBB,
and CCC) and one channel (rbo-001). The AAA subgroup contains two channels:
rai_2000 and rai_2001. The BBB subgroup contains the two channels: rbi_000 and
rbi_2000. The CCC subgroup contains only one channel: rbo_000. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In
this example the default mask &quot;-----&quot; is used for every channel. That
is, no masks are specified on the group and channel lines. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In above example,
$COMMAND and $GUIDANCE options are specified for the MAIN group. The $GUIDANCE
option allows the user to display guidance text in a popup window when the MAIN
group guidance button is pressed. The $COMMAND line option allows a user to
start the display manager, medm, by pressing the MAIN group's related proccess
button. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In above example, the
$COMMAND, $FORCEPV, and $SEVRPV options are specified for the AAA group. This
$COMMAND option allows a user to open an xterm window from the start related
process button on the AAA group line. The $FORCEPV option tells alh to add an
automatic force mask event for group AAA. If the value of process variable
FORCE:AI becomes 1, then the mask of all the channels in this group will be set
to the forceMask, &quot;-D---&quot;. If the value of process variable FORCE:AI
becomes 0, then the mask of all the channels in this group will be reset to
their default mask values. The $SEVRPV option tells alh to record the alarm
severity of group AAA to the process variable SEVR:AI.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="pgfId_694545"><a name=masks>Alarm Channel Mask</a></a></h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Associated with each
Alarm Channel are two five bit masks (default and current). The current mask
can be changed by force commands or by force process variables. The default
mask is defined in the alarm configuration file. A reset command forces all
associated masks to return to the default values.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The definition for each
bit in the mask value follows:<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Add/Cancel Alarm</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'> This mask bit determines if
a channel access add event is active. Add/Cancel means that a ca_add_event
is/isn't active. If ca_add_event is not active for a channel, the IOC will not
send alarm events to the alarm handler for that channel.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot; C&quot; means
cancel and &quot;-&quot; denotes add.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Enable/Disable Alarm</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Alarms aren't/are
ignored by the alarm handler. Disabling an alarm has the effect of no display
and NoAck. If an alarm is disabled the alarm status and severity are not
displayed. Thus, even though a ca_add_event is in effect, the channel always
appears to the operator to be in the NO_ALARM state. Alarm change of states
will, however, still be logged unless NoLog is in effect.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>
When a pv is enabled after it has been disabled for a while and the pv is
not in alarm state but there are unacknowledged transient alarms
and the alarm handler is running in global mode, an automatic
acknowledgement is sent when the pv is enabled and the auto acknowledgement
is logged in the opMod file if the alarm handler is running in global mode.
</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot; D&quot; means
alarm disabled.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Ack/NoAck</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The operator is/isn't
required to acknowledge alarms.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot; A&quot; means
alarm acknowledgment is not required.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Ack/NoAck Transient Alarms</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The operator is/isn't required
to acknowledge transient alarms. A transient alarm is one that enters alarm
state and then returns to normal before the operator can acknowledge the alarm.
</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot; T&quot; means acknowledgment of transient
alarms is not required.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:.5in'>Log/No Log Alarms</h3>
