     Bug fix:
     "Save as" now writes out ALARMCOUNTFILTER data

Thu Jan  9 08:36:21 CST 1997

     In this new alh version, the alarm log file has been changed to a circular log
     file with maximum records in the circular file defaulting to 2000. This means
     that after 2000 records exist in the alarm log file, the oldest alarm records
     will be overwritten when new alarms occur, thus keeping the file size a constant
     2000 records. The maximum number of records can be changed using a command line
     option m, e.g. "alh -m 5000" will make the alarm log file a circular file with a
     maximum of 5000 records.  The command "alh -m 0" can be used to allow the alarm
     log file to have an infinite number of records.

                        	alarmLog and alarmOpMod files.
	-S Passive Mode     --- means that operator can't acknowledge alarms 
                        	and can't save alarmLog and alarmOpMod files.
	-T AlarmLogDated    --- 1) alarmLog files will have "date" extensions 
                           	like YYYY-MM-DD, and automatical switching 
                           	this files in midnight.
	
                        	2)  We add FSbox for search LogFiles in 
                            	View->"Alarm Log File Window" and

	-P Printing         --- simultaneously printing Alarm to TCP printer
                        	(socket connection and so on). Now we print it
                        	asynchronous, so we add additional task "alh_printer"
                        	and modificate Makefile.Unix.

Wed Jul  1 15:02:21 CDT 1998

            $GUIDANCE  http://www.aps.anl.gov/asd/controls
        or text guidance -
            $GUIDANCE

	-D Disable Writing  --- allows work with alh without possibility 
	                        create/modify alarmLog and alarmOpMod files.
	-S Passive Mode     --- means that operator can't acknowledge alarms 
	                        and can't save alarmLog and alarmOpMod files.
	-T AlarmLogDated    --- 1) alarmLog and OpMod files will have "date" extension
	                           like YYYY-MM-DD, and automatical switching 
	                           this files in midnight.
	
	                        2)  We add FSbox for search LogFiles in 
	                            View->"Browser for Alarm Log" and 
	
	                        3) We add search button for finding string at LogFile.
				
	                        4) We add "Find from <t1> to <t2> with <String>" 
	                             widget, which allow search <String> from
	                             all AlLog-files at some directory
	                        
	-P Printing         --- simultaneously printing Alarm to TCP printer
	                        (socket connection and so on). Now we print it
	                        asynchronous, so we add additional task "alh_printer"
	                        and modificate Makefile.Unix.
	
	-L locking          --- allow multiple work with the same config files,
	                        only one process is real master and write to alhLog
	                        other is slave and they wait until master will not 
	                        killed 
	
	-0 Database(Oracle) --- simultaneously runtime add Alarm to Database.  It
	                        works asynchronous, so we add additional task "alh_DB"
	
	-B - message broadcasting -- allow send messages between operators work with
	                             same config file. Most important case: "REBOOT 
	                             MESSAGE": allow don't save alarm during reboot 
	                             time. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET ;)  )

	"NoAck for One Hour". Channel have Ack mask set to reset value
	after one hour. Ability to permanently noAck/Ack a group or
	channel. Groups or channels with 1 hour timer will display an

	more recent) timer.

	The text "ALH" has been added to the old Setup Beep Severity
	menu item and to the Beep Severity line in the main window message

	Now when a channel is enabled after being disabled and it is not

	compared to the forcePV forceValue and resetValue to determine whether
	to set group/channel masks to the forceMask or resetMask.

Fri Feb 28 16:38:19 CST 2003 ALH_1_2_11Beta4
